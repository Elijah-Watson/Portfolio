					<h2>General Skills</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Fast Learning</h3>
						<p>I always appreciate learning new things. Throughout my educational and professional career,
							my ability to learn quickly and independently has been one of my strongest skills. I apply
							this skill to the development process often, and I always enjoy learning new langauges,
							technologies, and other development skills.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
						<p>As someone who has always enjoyed math and science, critical thinking is second nature to me.
							When faced with any project or decision, I am able to quickly and thoroughly consider
							relevant information and then make an informed decision.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Problem Solving</h3>
						<p>One thing that has always drawn me to programming and web development is the problem solving
							aspect. Each new problem is like a puzzle that I enjoy solving. I take pride in being able
							to solve those problems quickly and creatively.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Time Management</h3>
						<p>As any developer knows, managing time effectively is an absolutely critical skill. Being able
							to switch between different aspects of the development process and manage deadlines in a way
							that ensures projects are completed on time is something I have always taken very seriously.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Communication</h3>
						<p>The ability to communicate complex, technical concepts into simple langauge has been an
							invaluable skill throughout my career and in life. In any setting, I always make an effort
							to communicate early and often.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

					<h2>Development Skills</h2>
					<div>
						<h3>Web Development</h3>
						<p>I have a passion for making beautiful, efficient websites. I have a thorough understanding of
							the web development process, and I keep learning more every day.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
						<p>The internet is always evolving, and web development has to evolve with it. In every project,
							ensuring it is fully functional on any device is a top priority of mine.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Cross-browser Compatibility</h3>
						<p>Not everyone uses the same browser. As a web developer, it is my responsiblity to make sure
							all popular browsers are able accounted for in any project, and I take that responsibility
							seriously.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>SEO</h3>
						<p>What good is a website if no one can find it? I make an effort to ensure every website and
							every page I design is built in a way that maximizes SEO potential.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Accessibility</h3>
						<p>It is my firm belief that everyone should have the ability to access websites despite their
							disabilities. Therefore, I always strive to ensure every part of any website I create is
							accessible.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Website Security</h3>
						<p>Nobody likes being hacked. When creating websites, I always give special consideration to
							security to ensure that both the website and its users are protected from attacks.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>UX & UI Design</h3>
						<p>When it comes to web development, end users are the final judges. Creating a beautiful and
							functional user experience is a part of the development process I take very seriously.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Troubleshooting & Debugging</h3>
						<p>Things never go perfectly; errors and bugs tend to pop up from time to time. Fortunately, I
							have extensive experience with finding and fixing issues quickly and effectively.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h3>Hosting & Maintenance</h3>
						<p>There's more to creating a website than just writing code. Getting it on the internet and
							keeping it there is no small feat. Through experience, I have learned the skills needed to
							do so effectively.</p>
